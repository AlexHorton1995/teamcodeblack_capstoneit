             * DATA TYPES can be known by many names (variables, containers, types).  In C#, 
             * you will use an abundance of different data types based on what you are attempting
             * to solve for.
             * 
             * C# is generally broken into two different types - Value Types and Reference Types
             * 
             * VALUE TYPES hold the data value inside its own memory space.  Value Types usually hold a value.
             * REFERENCE TYPES store the address of where the value is being stored.
             * 
             * Below are a few TYPES of Data Types that are available for you to use in C#
             *
